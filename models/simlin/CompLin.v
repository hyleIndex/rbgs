(** Compositional Linearizability (Definition 4.1, §4.3).

    This file mechanizes the trace-based correctness criterion of the paper
    directly on top of the thread-pool operational semantics already defined
    in [Semantics]: it introduces no new notion of step, it only assembles
    the existing [invstep]/[retstep]/[ustep]/[taustep]/[ts_error] relations
    into the trace semantics [[M]]_VE of §4.3, and compares it against the
    trace semantics of the identity implementation id_F, which plays the
    role of the atomic "copy-cat" specification.

    Undefined behavior (§4.3: "once a thread pool can error, any
    continuation is accepted") is modeled by an explicit, terminal trace
    marker [TErr] rather than by literally appending an arbitrary
    concrete tail. Appending an arbitrary tail directly into the generated
    trace set works for a single, non-composed object, but does not survive
    horizontal composition: the composed system could then "produce" a
    trace whose other-component-tagged tail is pure fabrication, unrelated
    to anything that component's own state ever did, breaking the trace
    containment used to relate the two components' [CompLin] hypotheses to
    the composed one. Recording instead that a run of [M] merely *reaches*
    a error at some point (with [TErr] a designator, not a wildcard) lets
    the generation relation ([trace_step]/[ImplTraces]) stay a precise,
    compositional description of what each component actually does; the
    "anything can happen afterwards" reading of undefined behavior is then
    pushed into the *comparison* against the specification only
    ([ImplTracesClosed]/[CompLin]), where it belongs: the specification
    side is compared up to "if it also errors at some prefix, that prefix
    licenses any continuation", while the implementation side is compared
    on the nose.

    [TErr] is tagged with the overlay operation [f : Sig.op F] whose thread
    was in flight at the moment of the error (mirroring [InvEv]/[ResEv],
    which are likewise tagged with the overlay operation they belong to).
    This is not just bookkeeping: it is exactly what lets horizontal
    composition ([CompLinHComp.v]) project a combined trace back
    onto its two components, since [f]'s tag (in the combined signature
    [Sig.Plus.omap F1 F2], either [inl _] or [inr _]) is the only way to
    tell, from the trace alone, which side actually errored — a bare,
    untagged [TErr] marker cannot be projected at all.

    This is intentionally independent from the speculative
    [Poss]/[AbstractConfig] machinery used by [TPSimulationSet] for the
    Threadpool Simulation (Definition 5.2); relating the two is
    [CompLinSound.v] (Lemma 5.3). *)

  (* Traces only record overlay (F) invocation/response events, plus a
     terminal marker for undefined behavior, tagged with the overlay
     operation of the thread that errored; §4.3. [TErr _] is never followed
     by further items: [trace_step] only ever appends it as the very last
     element (see [TraceStepError] below), so a trace either has no [TErr]
     at all, or has exactly one, at the end. *)

    (* A trace-generation configuration bundles the trace accumulated so

       as a dedicated record (rather than an anonymous pair) since this
       development's ambient categorical notations for [( _ , _ )] and
       [( _ , _ , .. )] are bound in scopes that shadow the plain pair
       constructor notation. *)

    (* One step of the trace-generation relation ↠ (§4.3):
       - starting an operation (tp-inv) or finishing one (tp-ret) extends
         the trace with the corresponding overlay event;
       - a library step (tp-step/[ustep]) or a silent step (tp-tau/
         [taustep]) leaves the trace unchanged, since the trace only
         collects overlay events;
       - once the current thread pool can error, the terminal [TErr] marker
         is appended, tagged with the overlay operation [f] of the
         offending thread: this designates undefined behavior at this
         exact point, without committing to (or fabricating) any specific
         concrete continuation. (Inlining [uerror]'s [Hfind]/[Herror]
         fields here, rather than using [uerror] itself as a premise, is
         what exposes [f] so it can be recorded in the trace.) *)
